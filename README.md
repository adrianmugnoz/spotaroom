I have focused on Frontend, so the backend it's just developed to work using KoaJS. If I had more time I would have added Typescript, tests and maybe Apollo.

For the Frontend, I started the project using CRA with Typescript. I defined the project structure that would scale well for a big project, and I used Styled Components for theming the application. There are no types for everything because of the time limitation.

There are some tests for the frontend client, just checking that the components renders without crash.

## Backend
In the project directory, go to /server directory and run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the server at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:3000).


## Frontend

In the project directory, go to /spotaroom folder and run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Runs the app tests.
